# [Project 3: Covid Data Analysis And Dashboard](https://github.com/Cameronpearl/Covid-EDA/tree/main)
this project uses SQLServer 2019 to analyize data from https://ourworldindata.org about COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations. I used Excel to clean the data then loaded it into a local database in SQLServer 2019. After exploring the data using SQL I created a Tableau dashboard for my findings.
